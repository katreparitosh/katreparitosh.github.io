<h3>Discourse Analytics of Political Speech Transcripts</h3>

In February 2019, I observed that all the leading political candidates were giving 2-4 speeches per day. They were campaigning for the April 2019 General Elections.
I wondered what are they talking about? What are they highlighting in the campaigns? How can we utilize NLP to analyze the speeches? 
This is how I laid my explorations in NLP and for over next 3 months I experimented a lot with Web Scraping, NLP-Analytics, Visual Analytics, etc.
I presented the outcomes of this project in 2 research papers published in a International Scopus Journal and an IEEE Conference.

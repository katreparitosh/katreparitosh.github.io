<h3>Foodify: An Android Application</h3>
<p align="justify">
	I developed this innovative "Search-Suggest" android application called "Foodify". The idea behind the app is to suggest the user what to cook 
	based on available ingredients entered. I wrote database function, SQLiteOpenHelper functions and designed the UI using Material Design. <br>
	Technical Concepts implemented within the app. <br>

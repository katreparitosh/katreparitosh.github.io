## A Little About Me

<p align="justify">
  
ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I am Paritosh.<br><br>

I am a MS in Computer Science grad student at <a href = "https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering.html"> University at Buffalo, New York </a>. Currently, I am affiliated with <a href = "https://www.xlab-ub.com/research"> X-LAB @ UB </a> where I am conducting research on the topic of "Science of Science" advised by Prof. <a href = "https://www.xlab-ub.com/home">Jinjun Xiong</a>.<br><br>

Prior to grad school, I was remotely working as an NLP Lead on end-to-end research, design, development, and deployment of NLP Systems for <a href = "http://citispotter.com/"> Citispotter Limited</a>, Cambridge, UK. I was a part of the early team at the startup which built the beta product receiving global attention and users.<br><br>
  
I was responsible for training-deploying NLP models for Large-Scale Text Classification tasks, designing NLP algorithms, AWS Cloud Deployments, building workflows for Continuous Retraining (Online Learning) to tackle Data/Concept Drifts, Data Augmentation, and evaluation of NLP/ML solutions for Bias & Fairness, Behavioral - Adversarial Testing, and Linguistic Capabilities.<br><br>
  
This early startup experience taught me a lot of things. I learned the importance of attacking problems at hand, delivery-oriented research, and finding the correct spot in product development & business objectives.<br><br>

As an undergraduate, I majored in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.viit.ac.in/">Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology (VIIT)</a> in 2020. It was a very fruitful time in my life as I invested a lot of time participating in cultural events and competitions. I learnt a lot about social connections, maintaining and nurturing people relations.<br><br> 

In 2019, I interned at the Applied AI Group of <a href = "https://www.cdac.in/">Center for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC)</a>, Pune as part of my year long final year thesis project. I worked on an AI-NLP task of Event Prediction to predict potential crime/terrorist activities from unstructured textual corpora. The vision was to design a predictive algorithm and build a working prototype to demonstrate a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-crime">Pre-crime Tool</a>.<br><br>

Generally, I enjoy working on projects which have my independent thought and concept behind them. It is challenging, but I believe it's an essential growth skill.

On the fun side, I am also a passionate musician actively composing original music that finds the sweet spot between Indian Classical Ragas and Western Orchestral Soundscape. I arrange, produce music, and enjoy learning new instruments!.<br><br>

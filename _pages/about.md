My name is Paritosh Katre and I'm currently a final year CSE Undergrad student at Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology (VIIT). Currently, I'm doing my year long research internship at Applied Artificial Intelligence (AAI) Group at the Center for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Pune, India. 

My research interests are Natural Language Processing (NLP), Big Data and AI-Analytics. In future, I want to research on Multi-lingual NLP, Sentient AI and Computational Musicology.  

I enjoy working on projects which have my independent thought and concept behind it. It is challenging, but is an essential growth skill.

Besides, I am a passionate musician. For the last 5 yars, I have been composing and producing music that blends Indian Classical Ragas and Western Chord soundscape. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/geetdnyaneshwari"> Geet Dnyaneshwari </a>: "Rendering of divine melody quietly present in Dnyaneshwari", a novel experimental musical project, where I have composed over 30 songs together with my father, each distinct in its beauty and aesthetic meaning.

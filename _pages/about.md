My name is Paritosh Katre and I'm currently a final year CSE undergrad student at <a href="http://www.viit.ac.in/">Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology (VIIT)</a>. Currently, I'm doing my year long research internship at Applied Artificial Intelligence (AAI) Group at the <a href="https://www.cdac.in/"> Center for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC)</a>, Pune, India. 

My research interests are <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing"> Natural Language Processing (NLP) </a>, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">Big Data</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"> Artificial Intelligence</a>. In future, I want to research on <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_consciousness">Sentient AI (Artificial Consciousness)</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_musicology">Computational Musicology.</a> 

I enjoy working on projects which have my independent thought and concept behind it. It is challenging, but is an essential growth skill.

Besides, I am a passionate musician. For the last 5 yars, I have been composing and producing music that blends Indian Classical Ragas and Western Chord soundscape. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/geetdnyaneshwari"> Geet Dnyaneshwari </a> *Rendering of divine melody quietly present in Dnyaneshwari*, a novel experimental musical project, where I have composed over 30 songs together with my father, each distinct in its beauty and aesthetic meaning.

## **<center>A LITTLE ABOUT ME</center>**

<p align="justify">
  
I am a NLP Scientist/Researcher skilled in conducting R&D at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Applied ML, Language Science, and Computational Linguistics.<br><br>
  
Presently, I am working as a Data Scientist at <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal"> PayPal Inc. </a> with the Applied Science group under the Customer Success Org to build the core AI/NLP capabilities supporting Customer Success Platform (CSP).<br><br>

In Dec 2022, I graduated with an MS in Computer Science from the <a href = "https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering.html"> University at Buffalo, New York </a>. During that period, I was affiliated with <a href = "https://www.xlab-ub.com/research"> X-LAB @ UB </a> where I conducted research on the topic of "Science of Science" advised by <a href = "https://www.xlab-ub.com/research"> Prof. Jinjun Xiong</a>. You can read more about this research <a href = "https://katreparitosh.github.io/research/">here</a>.<br><br>

Prior relocating to the US, I remotely worked as a NLP Lead Engineer on end-to-end research, design, development, and deployment of NLP Systems for <a href = "http://citispotter.com/"> Citispotter Limited</a>, Cambridge, UK. I was part of the founding team which built the alpha product receiving global attention and users in the field of AI-based Content Writing Assistants. This early stage startup experience taught me a lot of things. I majorly learned about independent thinking, problem identification, and solving problems in delivery-oriented research settings.<br><br>

<!---
I was responsible for training-deploying NLP models for Large-Scale Text Classification tasks, designing NLP algorithms, AWS Cloud Deployments, building workflows for Continuous Retraining (Online Learning) to tackle Data/Concept Drifts, Data Augmentation, and evaluation of NLP/ML solutions for Bias & Fairness, Behavioral - Adversarial Testing, and Linguistic Capabilities.<br><br>

As an undergraduate, I majored in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.viit.ac.in/">Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology (VIIT)</a> in 2020. It was a very fruitful time in my life as I invested a lot of time participating in cultural events and competitions. I learnt a lot about building social connections, maintaining and nurturing people relations.<br><br> 

In 2019, I got an opportunity to intern at the Applied AI Group of <a href = "https://www.cdac.in/">Center for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Pune</a>, as part of my year long final year thesis project. I worked on an AI-NLP task of Event Prediction to predict potential crime/terrorist activities from unstructured textual corpora. The vision was to design a predictive algorithm and build a working prototype to demonstrate a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-crime">Pre-crime Tool</a>.

In parallel, I am also a musician passionately interested in composing music which attempts to find the sweet spots between the Indian Classical Raagas and the Western Orchestral Soundscapes.<br><br>

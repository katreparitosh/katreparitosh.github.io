I'm pursing Bachelor of Engineering (BE) in Computer Engineering at <a href="http://www.viit.ac.in/">Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology (VIIT)</a>. My research interests are <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing"> Natural Language Processing (NLP) </a>, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">Big Data</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"> Artificial Intelligence</a>. In future, I want to research in <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_consciousness">Sentient AI (Artificial Consciousness)</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_musicology">Computational Musicology.</a> 

Currently, I am interning with <a href = "http://citispotter.com/"> Citispotter Limited </a> which is UK based Tech-Startup that provides AI enabled solutions to fight fake news, misinformation and hate speech.  

I preiviously interned at the Applied Artificial Intelligence (AAI) Group of <a href="https://www.cdac.in/"> Center for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC)</a>, Pune, India as part of year long final year thesis project. I worked on an AI-NLP task of Event Prediction to predict potential crime/terrorist activities form unstructured textual corpus. The vision was to design a  rule-based algorithm and build a working prototype to demonstrate a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-crime#:~:text=Pre%2Dcrime%20intervenes%20to%20punish,occurred%20is%20a%20foregone%20conclusion"> Pre-crime Tool </a>. 

Generally, I enjoy working on projects which have my independent thought and concept behind it. It is challenging, but I believe it's an essential growth skill.

Apart from research, I am passionate about many other activites. Refer the <a href = "https://katreparitosh.github.io/personal/"> Personal </a> tab above to read about my other pursuits.

<div style="text-align: justify">
I'm currently a senior year Computer Science undergraduate student at <a href="http://www.viit.ac.in/">Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology (VIIT)</a>. Currently, I am interning with <a href = "http://citispotter.com/"> Citispotter Limited </a> which is UK based Tech-Startup that provides AI enabled solutions to fight fake news, misinformation and hate speech. <br><br>

My research interests broadly lie in the fields of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing"> Natural Language Processing (AI-NLP) </a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning"> Machine Learning (AI/ML) </a>. I am enthusiastic about doing applied research and colaboration in these fields. Given a chance, I want to research in <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_consciousness">Sentient AI (Artificial Consciousness)</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_musicology">Computational Musicology.</a> <br><br>

I previously interned at the Applied Artificial Intelligence (AAI) Group of <a href="https://www.cdac.in/"> Center for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC)</a>, Pune, India as part of year long final year thesis project. I worked on an AI-NLP task of Event Prediction to predict potential crime/terrorist activities form unstructured textual corpus. The vision was to design a  rule-based algorithm and build a working prototype to demonstrate a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-crime#:~:text=Pre%2Dcrime%20intervenes%20to%20punish,occurred%20is%20a%20foregone%20conclusion"> Pre-crime Tool </a>. <br><br>

Generally, I enjoy working on projects which have my independent thought and concept behind it. It is challenging, but I believe it's an essential growth skill.<br><br>

Apart from research, I am passionate about many other activites. Refer the <a href = "https://katreparitosh.github.io/personal/"> Personal Tab </a> to read about my other pursuits!

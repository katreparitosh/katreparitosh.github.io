## A Little About Me

<p align="justify">
  
ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I am Paritosh.<br><br> 

Currently, I am remotely working as a NLP Lead on end-to-end research, design, development, and deployment of NLP Systems for <a href = "http://citispotter.com/"> Citispotter Limited</a>, Cambridge, UK. Citispotter is a UK-based tech-startup that provides AI-driven technologies for intelligent content analysis to optimize emotional engagement, identify harmful signals, and assess content credibility.<br><br> 

I am interested in conducting research at the intersection of Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), MLOPs and AI-driven Products.<br><br>

As an undergraduate, I majored in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.viit.ac.in/">Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology (VIIT)</a> in 2020.<br><br> 

In 2019, I interned at the Applied AI Group of <a href = "https://www.cdac.in/">Center for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC)</a>, Pune as part of my year long final year thesis project. I worked on an AI-NLP task of Event Prediction to predict potential crime/terrorist activities form unstructured textual corpora. The vision was to design a predictive algorithm and build a working prototype to demonstrate a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-crime">Pre-crime Tool</a>.<br><br>

Generally, I enjoy working on projects which have my independent thought and concept behind it. It is challenging, but I believe it's an essential growth skill.  Given a chance, I want to research about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_consciousness">Sentient AI (Artificial Consciousness)</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_musicology">Computational Musicology</a> where my research and creative interests both converge.<br><br>

On the fun side, I am also a passionate musician actively composing original music that finds the sweet spot between Indian Classical Ragas and Western Orchestral Soundscape. I arrange, produce music, and play 5 instruments as well.<br><br>

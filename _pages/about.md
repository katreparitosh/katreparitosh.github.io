## A Little About Me

<div style="text-align: justify">
  
ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I am Paritosh. 

I recently finished my undergrad in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.viit.ac.in/">Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology (VIIT)</a>.<br><br> 

Currently, I am remotely working as a NLP Lead on end-to-end research, design, build, development, and deployment of NLP Systems for <a href = "http://citispotter.com/"> Citispotter Limited </a>, Cambridge, UK. Citispotter is a UK-based tech-startup that provides AI-driven technologies for intelligent content analysis to optimize emotional engagement, identify harmful signals, and assess content credibility.<br><br> 

I am interested in conducting E2E applied research in the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), MLOPs and AI-driven Product Conceptualization. Given a chance, I want to research about [Sentient AI (Artificial Consciousness)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_consciousness) and [Computational Musicology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_musicology) where my research and creative interests both converge.<br><br>

In 2019, I interned at the Applied AI Group of [Center for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC)](https://www.cdac.in/)Pune as part of my year long final year thesis project. I worked on an AI-NLP task of Event Prediction to predict potential crime/terrorist activities form unstructured textual corpora. The vision was to design an algorithm and build a working prototype to demonstrate a [Pre-crime Tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-crime).<br><br>

Generally, I enjoy working on projects which have my independent thought and concept behind it. It is challenging, but I believe it's an essential growth skill.<br><br>

On the fun side, I am a passionate musician actively composing original music that finds the sweet spot between Indian Classical Ragas and Western Orchestral Soundscape. I also produce music and play 5 instruments as well.

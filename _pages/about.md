Before relocating to the US in 2021, Paritosh joined <a href = "http://citispotter.com/"> Citispotter Limited</a> as a Founding NLP Engineer to conduct end-to-end research, design, development, and deployment of NLP Systems for the startup. As a member of the founding team, he built the alpha release receiving global attention and users in the area of AI-based Content Writing Assistants. This early-stage startup experience helped him develop skills in independent thinking, problem identification, and problem-solving in delivery-oriented research settings.<br><br>

<!---
I was responsible for training-deploying NLP models for Large-Scale Text Classification tasks, designing NLP algorithms, AWS Cloud Deployments, building workflows for Continuous Retraining (Online Learning) to tackle Data/Concept Drifts, Data Augmentation, and evaluation of NLP/ML solutions for Bias & Fairness, Behavioral - Adversarial Testing, and Linguistic Capabilities.<br><br>

Paritosh holds a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (May 2020) from <a href="http://www.viit.ac.in/">Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology (VIIT)</a>, affiliated with the <a href="http://www.unipune.ac.in/">University of Pune</a>. Alongside his academics, he actively participated in cultural events and competitions.<br><br> 

In 2019, Paritosh interned at the Applied AI Group of <a href = "https://www.cdac.in/">Center for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Pune</a>, as part of his final year thesis project. He worked on an AI-NLP problem in the domain of event prediction, specifically the prediction of crime and terrorist activities from unstructured corpora. The vision was to design a predictive algorithm and build a working prototype to demonstrate a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-crime">Pre-crime Tool</a>.

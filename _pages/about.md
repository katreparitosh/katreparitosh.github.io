My name is Shreyas Skandan and I'm currently a PhD Student in the CIS Programme at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm part of the G.R.A.S.P Laboratory, at the [Kumar Robotics Lab](https://www.kumarrobotics.org) under [Dr. Camillo J. Taylor](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cjtaylor/) and I previously worked at the [Rehabilitation Robotics Lab](http://www.med.upenn.edu/rehabilitation-robotics-lab/
) under Dr. Michelle Johnson. My research focus is Computer Vision and Deep Learning applied to mobile robots, with a special interest in stereo depth estimation.

I previously worked as an Application Developer at the Kumar Robotics Lab, after I graduated from the M.S.E in Robotics programme at Penn. 

I worked on my Master's Thesis under Dr. Camillo J. Taylor, which was "A survey of High Performance Dense Stereo Algorithms for Real Time Depth Estimation" -- a video of the presentation can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvHdOKvwGQw&feature=youtu.be&t=1h11m34s).

# <center>RESOURCES</center>

I generally spend time a lot of time searching for relevant resources to broaden my knowledge and learn new things. Hence, as a habit, I always pool the links in an excel sheet to keep the assortment handy. It's always good to have the resources around to quickly read important concepts and troubleshoot problems.  

Thought of listing down some material that I keep a track of and which I felt was extremely useful :)

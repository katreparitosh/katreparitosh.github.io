Alongside research and academics, I actively pursue a few hobbies.
<br>
* <b>Music</b>
Besides, I am a passionate musician. For the last 5 years, I have been composing and producing original music that blends Indian Classical Ragas and Western Chord soundscape. 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/geetdnyaneshwari"> Geet Dnyaneshwari : Rendering of divine melody quietly present in Dnyaneshwari</a>, a novel experimental musical project, 
where I have composed over 30 songs together with my father, each distinct in its beauty, meaning and aesthetic sense. 
I primarily use <a href = "https://www.apple.com/in/mac/garageband/">Garageband</a>, <a href = "https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/">FL Studio</a> and 
<a href = "https://www.spitfireaudio.com/labs/">Spitfire Audio</a> for my production and recording purposes. <br> 
I have been the Head of Music Team of my college theater group and I have performed in college festival concerts.  
<br>
* <b> Birding and Photography </b>
For the last 10 years, I have formed a deep in interesting identifying birds and photographing them. I occasionaly visit the nearby hills

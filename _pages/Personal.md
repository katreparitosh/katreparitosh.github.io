Alongside research and academics, I passionately pursue a few hobbies.
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">
*<b> Music </b><br>
I am a passionate musician. For the last 5 years, I have been composing and producing original music that blends Indian Classical Ragas and Western Chord soundscape. 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/geetdnyaneshwari"> Geet Dnyaneshwari : Rendering of divine melody quietly present in Dnyaneshwari</a>, a novel experimental musical project, 
where I have composed over 30 songs together with my father, each distinct in its beauty, meaning and aesthetic sense. 
I primarily use <a href = "https://www.apple.com/in/mac/garageband/">Garageband</a>, <a href = "https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/">FL Studio</a>,
<a href = "https://www.spitfireaudio.com/labs/">Spitfire Audio</a> and <a href = "https://focusrite.com/en"> Focusrite </a> for my music recording and production purposes.<br> 
I have been the Head of Music Team of my college music group during cultural concerts and inter-state theater competitions. 
<br><br>
*<b> Birding and Photography </b><br>
Around 10 years ago, I developed a deep interest in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithology"> Ornithology </a>, Bird-watching and Photography. I make it a point to <i>bird</i> every now and then. Hence, birding has unintentionally become a sub-conscious habit wherever I go ;-)

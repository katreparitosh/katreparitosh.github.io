Alongside research and academics, I passionately pursue a few hobbies.
<br>

<b> Music </b>

I am a passionate musician. For the last 5 years, I have been composing and producing original music that blends Indian Classical Ragas and Western Chord soundscape. 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/geetdnyaneshwari"> Geet Dnyaneshwari : Rendering of divine melody quietly present in Dnyaneshwari</a>, a novel experimental musical project, 
where I have composed over 30 songs together with my father, each distinct in its beauty, meaning and aesthetic sense. 
I primarily use <a href = "https://www.apple.com/in/mac/garageband/">Garageband</a>, <a href = "https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/">FL Studio</a>,
<a href = "https://www.spitfireaudio.com/labs/">Spitfire Audio</a> and <a href = "https://focusrite.com/en"> Focusrite </a> for my music recording and production purposes. I play over 5 instruments and I have been the Head of Music Team of the college music group during cultural concerts and inter-state theater competitions.

In May 2019, our intitiative was covered by a leading national newspaper, Sakal, for their front page story! (See below)

<b> Birding and Photography </b>

When I was 10 years old, I developed a deep interest in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithology"> Ornithology </a>, Bird-watching and Photography. As a school-going kid, I would regularly go out on weekends to <b><i>bird</i></b> with my friends, come home, edit the photographs on Adobe Photoshop, and upload on Facebook. This was a ritual until high-school, but now, birding and nature-walks have become more personal and relaxing ventures :)

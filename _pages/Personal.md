In my free time, I passionately pursue a few other interests.
<br>

<ins><b>Music</b></ins>

Since the last couple of years, I have developed a deep interest in music composition and producing original music which blends Indian Classical Ragas and Western Chords Soundscape. "<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/geetdnyaneshwari">Geet Dnyaneshwari</a>" (Rendering of divine melody quietly present in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnyaneshwari">Dnyaneshwari</a>), a novel experimental musical project, 
where I have composed over 40 songs together with my father, each distinct in its beauty, meaning and aesthetic sense. 
I primarily rely on <a href = "https://www.apple.com/in/mac/garageband/">Garageband</a>, <a href = "https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/">FL Studio</a>,
<a href = "https://www.spitfireaudio.com/labs/">Spitfire Audio</a>, <a href = "https://focusrite.com/en"> Focusrite </a> for music recording and production. In the past, I also led our college music group during cultural concerts and musical theaters. I really enjoy learning and collecting musical instruments.

<ins><b>Birding and Photography</b></ins>

When I was in school, I developed a liking in Birdwatching (<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithology">Ornithology</a>) and Photography. Back then, I would regularly go out for photography, and experiment with image editors like Adobe Photoshop. This was a ritual until college, but now, birding, and nature-walks have become more personal and relaxing ventures :)
